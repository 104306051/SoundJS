		<p>Audio in HTML is promising, but can be quite difficult to work with. Each browser has a similar but different approach, which requires a lot of guess and test, and edge cases, which can add up to a lot of time spent. The SoundJS JavaScript library provides a simple API, and some powerful features to make working with audio a breeze.</p>
<p class="callout"><strong>examples:</strong>

		<a href="examples/interrupt.html">Interrupt</a>,

      </p>
		<p>For an example of SoundJS being used in a large-scale project, see <a href="http://pirateslovedaisies.com/">Pirates Love Daisies</a>, which uses techniques and approaches that were eventually rolled into SoundJS.</p>

		<p>SoundJS was built byÂ <a href="http://gskinner.com/">gskinner.com</a>, and is released under the MIT license, which means you can use it freely for almost any purpose (including commercial projects). We appreciate credit where appropriate, but it is not a requirement.</p>
		<p>SoundJS is currently in early alpha. We will be making significant improvements to the library, samples, and documentation over the coming weeks. Please be aware that this may necessitate changes to the existing API.</p>
		<p>In our preliminary testing, SoundJS appears to be fully compatible with Android, and all major desktop browsers that support the canvas element.</p>

		<p> The key features are: </p>
		<h3>Channel Management</h3>
		<p>Deals with the maximums in different browsers, as well as helping determine the best channel to interrupt when dealing with multiple sounds of the same kind.</p>
        <h3>Batch Loading</h3>
		<p>Manages the preloading of a sound queue.</p>
		<h3>Master Volume Control</h3>
		<p>Control individual sound volume, or the volume of all sound channels at once, including muting.</p>
		
		<p>Have a look at the full <a href="docs/">API documentation</a> for more info.</p>

		<h3>Planned updates</h3>
		<p>SoundJS will be updated as time permits. We're not making any promises, but here are some of the things we're thinking of doing:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Smooth progress</li>
			<li>Optimization</li>
		</ul>
